Libraries needed in general:
- pyvisa
    - note that pyvisa.ResourceManager() won't work if installed alone
        - ValueError: Could not locate a VISA implementation. Install either the NI binary or pyvisa-py.
        - I tried installing the pyvisa-py package, but still got the same error
        - The solution was to download Ultra Sigma from Rigol, which apparently includes the NI binary (IVI something or other)
- time
- serial

Convention used in the Classes for different equipment types:
- self.rm = pyvisa.ResourceManager(). Eg something to facilitate interation with VISA
- self.inst = instance of the object. Eg the object that rm.open_resource(addr) returns
- self.connected = Boolean for whether the equipment is connected
- self.devID = inst.query("*IDN?"). The device ID I think
- self.fault = not sure yet, but probably just a heads up something is wrong



Rigol MSO5000 misc notes:
- programming guide:
    - https://int.rigol.com/Images/MSO5000ProgrammingGuideEN_tcm7-4051.pdf
- Removing the USB and then sticking it back in might cause problems (eg "unknown system miscellaneous error")
    - Try clearing environment variables. Then try restarting Spyder
